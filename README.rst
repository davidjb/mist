Mist
====

In Norse mythology, `Mist` is a valkyrie, and the name is believed to stem
from `mistr`, meaning `cloud, mist`. Little information is known about
this valkyrie, much like this project.  Much like a valkyrie, this project 
may ensure your survival if your requirements match what it does.

This is a Pyramid-based project that creates live tag clouds using the
`d3-cloud <https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud>`_ library from various
sources.
